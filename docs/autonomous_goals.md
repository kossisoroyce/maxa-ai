# Autonomous Goal Generation System

This document describes the autonomous goal generation system in Maxa Anima, which allows the AI to create its own goals based on patterns, user interactions, and system needs.

## Overview

The autonomous goal generation system enables the AI to:

1. Create goals based on interaction patterns
2. Schedule time-based goals (e.g., weekly check-ins)
3. Identify knowledge gaps and create learning goals
4. Maintain system health through maintenance goals
5. Adapt to user behavior over time

## Key Components

### 1. Goal Generation Triggers

Goals can be triggered by:

- **Time-based**: Scheduled at regular intervals (e.g., weekly check-ins)
- **Interaction Patterns**: Repeated topics or questions from the user
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Areas where the AI lacks information
- **System Needs**: Maintenance and self-improvement tasks

### 2. Safety Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum of 5 autonomous goals per day
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Only create goals with sufficient confidence
- **User Approval**: High-priority goals require explicit approval
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents duplicate or conflicting goals
- **Transparent Logging**: All autonomous actions are logged

### 3. Goal Types

1. **Learning Goals**: Improve knowledge in specific areas
2. **Maintenance Goals**: System updates and checks
3. **User Interaction Goals**: Improve responses based on user patterns
4. **Time-based Goals**: Regular check-ins and reviews

## Usage

### Creating Autonomous Goals

Autonomous goals are created automatically based on the system's interactions with the user. You can also trigger goal generation manually:

```python
# In AgentCore
self._process_autonomous_goals()
```

### Configuration

Key configuration parameters in `AutonomousGoalGenerator`:

- `max_goals_per_day`: Maximum number of autonomous goals per day (default: 5)
- `min_confidence`: Minimum confidence threshold for goal creation (0.0-1.0)
- `requires_approval_above_priority`: Priority level above which user approval is needed

### Testing

Run the test script to verify autonomous goal generation:

```bash
python test_autonomous_goals.py
```

## Implementation Details

### Goal Generation Process

1. **Evaluation**: Check if conditions are met for goal creation
2. **Suggestion**: Generate potential goal suggestions
3. **Validation**: Apply safety checks and conflict detection
4. **Creation**: Create and store the goal
5. **Notification**: Inform the user about the new goal

### Data Storage

Autonomous goals are stored in the same system as user-created goals, with additional metadata:

```json
{
  "id": "goal_123",
  "title": "Learn about Python",
  "metadata": {
    "auto_generated": true,
    "trigger": "interaction_pattern",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "source": "autonomous_goals"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a limited set of goal types and expand gradually
2. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on the goals being created
3. **Gather Feedback**: Use user feedback to improve goal generation
4. **Log Everything**: Maintain detailed logs for debugging and improvement

## Troubleshooting

- **No goals being created**: Check the confidence threshold and interaction history
- **Too many goals**: Adjust the rate limiting parameters
- **Inappropriate goals**: Review the goal generation logic and add more constraints

## Future Enhancements

1. More sophisticated pattern recognition
2. User feedback integration for goal quality
3. Adaptive learning of goal generation parameters
4. Integration with external knowledge sources
