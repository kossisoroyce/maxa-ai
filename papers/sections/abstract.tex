This paper presents Maxa, a cognitive architecture that implements \textit{eternal inference} for building persistent AI assistants with Theory of Mind capabilities. Maxa's novel architecture combines a local Qdrant vector database with OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo to achieve low-latency, context-aware interactions while maintaining long-term memory and user context. Our evaluation over a two-week study with four participants demonstrates the system's ability to maintain coherent, personalized conversations with an average response time of 1.2 seconds and 92\% memory recall accuracy. The system's modular design enables seamless integration of new capabilities while maintaining performance on standard hardware. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of next-generation AI assistants and outline directions for future research in eternal inference systems.
