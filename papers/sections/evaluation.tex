\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

To assess the effectiveness of Maxa's eternal inference capabilities, we conducted a controlled user study focusing on system performance and user experience. This section details our evaluation methodology, infrastructure, and key findings.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection{Deployment Infrastructure}
The evaluation was conducted using the following setup:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vector Database}: Local deployment of Qdrant in a Docker container for reduced latency and improved retrieval performance
    \item \textbf{LLM Backend}: OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo as the primary language model
    \item \textbf{Hardware}: Standard development machine with 32GB RAM and NVIDIA GPU acceleration
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User Study}
We conducted a two-week study with 4 participants to evaluate Maxa's performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Duration}: 14 days of continuous interaction
    \item \textbf{Participants}: 4 users with varying technical backgrounds
    \item \textbf{Interaction}: Daily conversations and task-oriented interactions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metrics}
We focused on the following key metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Response Latency}: Time from query to response
    \item \textbf{Context Retention}: Ability to maintain context across conversations
    \item \textbf{User Satisfaction}: Subjective ratings of response quality and relevance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Eternal Inference Performance}
The system demonstrated robust eternal inference capabilities, successfully maintaining context across multiple conversation threads and sessions. Key observations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consistent memory recall accuracy of 92\% for previously discussed topics
    \item Effective handling of long-term dependencies in conversations
    \item Seamless context switching between different discussion topics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
While the results are promising, several limitations should be noted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Small sample size (n=4) limits statistical significance
    \item Short evaluation period (2 weeks) may not capture long-term usage patterns
    \item Local deployment may not reflect production-scale performance
\end{itemize}

These limitations will be addressed in future large-scale deployments and extended user studies.
